Over my career, I’ve found myself a product manager by accident. I was doing different jobs with different titles, all while building products that solved people’s problems—defining and Prioritising roadmaps, managing stakeholders and a bunch of things we expect of product managers.

Eventually, I had the title of product manager, and I got to work with a fantastic team at [Ocado Technology][def]. Here, I learned product craft, it was a big switch to moving from delivering features to delivering value.
